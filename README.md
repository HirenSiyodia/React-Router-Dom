# React + Vite

React Router DOM is used for routing in React apps. It allows navigation between pages without reloading the whole app. React Router DOM makes SPA (Single Page Application) navigation smooth by handling dynamic routing, nested layouts, route params, and navigation hooks — all declaratively in React.

# 📦 Features
- Makes it easy to read and understand the navigation flow.
- Routing is defined using React components (<Route>, <Routes>, <Link>, etc.)
- Routes are generated dynamically as components render.
- You can pass parameters like /user/:id and fetch data based on id.
- Keeps layouts consistent while switching child components.
- Hooks like useParams() help extract them -> Access route parameters.
- Provides declarative navigation with <Link> and <NavLink>.
- <Outlet /> acts as a placeholder for nested routes.
